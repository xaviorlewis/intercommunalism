# intercommunalism
**an online installation discussing the importance of Huey P. Newton's seminal theory.**

The theory of Revolutionary Intercommunalism, as posited by Huey P. Newton, represents a crucial precursor to contemporary movements such as postcolonial globalization, abolitionism, and the development of racial capitalism. This theory can be viewed as an antifragile unifying theory of empire that challenges traditional notions of sovereignty and nation-states.

Newton's theory, by laying the groundwork for global networks of resistance, serves as a call to action for contemporary anti-colonial struggles. By analyzing the interconnectedness of various struggles against oppression, this thesis highlights the continued relevance of intercommunalism in situating foundational theories in the modern world, as well as an investigation into the current era of global racialised capitalism and ongoing liberation movements.

In light of the enduring significance of intercommunalism, this thesis advocates for a medium that fosters engagement and inclusivity. A digital platform, such as a website installation, provides an accessible and immersive way for users to engage with the material. This medium also reflects the principles of intercommunalism, which emphasize community-driven collaboration and collective action.

The intellectual contributions of oppressed individuals from around the world are frequently overlooked, primarily due to the lack of attention their work receives. To truly appreciate and acknowledge the significance of their scholarship, it is essential to engage fully with this installation. Please note that the installation is designed to be watched in its entirety.
